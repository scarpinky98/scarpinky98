- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to building websites, hopefully on a team, whenevere I'm good enough, and making a career out of coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on codecademy. Right now learning to use css, still getting the hang of it. Now I'm learning to use github and everything that it has to offer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on future projects with a team, wheather it is at a start-up, a non profit, or a well rooted company. Just want to leave a mark with my team.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
